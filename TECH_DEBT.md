# Technical Debt Register

## P0 - Blocking
- [ ] None currently

## P1 - Important
- [ ] Replace in-memory rate limiter with Redis (scales better)
- [ ] Add database connection pooling (performance)

## P2 - Nice to Have
- [ ] Migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL (better JSON support)
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry tracing (observability)

## P3 - Someday Maybe
- [ ] Rewrite tests in TypeScript instead of mocks
- [ ] Add GraphQL layer on top of tRPC
```

**Rule**: Fix 1 tech debt item per sprint (even if small)
